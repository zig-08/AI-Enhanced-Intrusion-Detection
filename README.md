# ðŸ›¡ AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS)  
### Cybersecurity Threat Detection Using Machine Learning

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

In an increasingly interconnected digital landscape, the security of organizational networks and sensitive data is of paramount importance. This project focuses on the development of an *AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System* that leverages machine learning to detect, classify, and respond to network intrusions with high accuracy.

By combining advanced *Random Forest Classification* with cybersecurity domain knowledge, the system empowers organizations to proactively combat evolving threats.

## ðŸ›  *Technologies Used*

- *Python 3.10+*
- *Flask (Backend Web Framework)*
- *HTML / CSS (Frontend UI)*
- *Pandas / NumPy (Data Manipulation)*
- *Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)*
- *Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for Class Balancing)*
- *Joblib (Model Serialization)*

## ðŸ§  *Model Details*

The Intrusion Detection System uses a *Random Forest Classifier* trained on a preprocessed and balanced network intrusion dataset. The model is enhanced with *SMOTE* to handle class imbalance.

The final model is saved as:

bash
```
random_forest_model_4_features.joblib
```
